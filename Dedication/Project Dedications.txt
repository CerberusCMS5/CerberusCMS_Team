Dedication for my real biological mother and my real biological father. My papa. The King and the drug Baron of East Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
Kern County took me from my biological father when I was 2 years old after Crips shot 2 bullets into the window of his lowrider when I was in the passenger seat in Los Angeles, California.
Kern County changed my name and gave me to my step-dad.

I started writing the source programming code of this Web Application for him and the Nazilowrider Car Club in the year ~2000 so that we could communicate over the Internet,
so they could sell product and so that he could always prove where he was located at to us by instant message. These were the years of AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger and
Microsoft Windows 1998.

I started writing this web application for the Nazilowrider Car Club and the Vagos Motorcycle Club in the year ~2000 - ~2001,
but we also extended it to the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club of Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California.

I started writing this web application project in ~2000 when I was ~13.

I did a complete re-write of this web application programming code from 2021 to 2024.

What does this web application do now ? This web application allows the users to communicate and record live video to the web application from any mobile device including smart glasses.
Any motorcyclist, driver, traveler can record everything in the area and show their current location with altitude down to 10 feet.
