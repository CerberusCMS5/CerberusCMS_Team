Dedication for my real biological mother and my real biological father. My papa. The King and the drug Baron of East Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
Kern County took me from my biological father when I was 2 years old after a crip shot 2 bullets into the window of his lowrider when I was in the passenger seat in Los Angeles, California.

I started making this web application for him in ~2000 so that we could communicate over the Internet, so he could sell product and so that he could always prove where he was located at to us by instant message.

I started writing this web application project in ~2000 when I was ~13.

I did a complete re-write of this web application programming code from 2021 to 2024.

1988, 1990, 1992, 1994.
