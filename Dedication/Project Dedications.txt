Project Dedication for my real biological mother and my real biological father. My papa. The King and the drug Baron of East Bakersfield, California and Los Angeles, California.
Kern County took me from my biological father when I was 2 years old after Crips gang members shot 2 bullets into the window of his lowrider when I was in the passenger seat in Los Angeles, California.
Kern County changed my name after that and gave me to my step-dad.

I started writing the source programming code of this Web Application for him and the Nazilowrider Car Club in the year ~2000 so that we could communicate over the Internet,
so they could sell product and so that he could always prove where he was located at to us by instant message. These were the years of AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger and
Microsoft Windows 1998.

I started writing this Web Application for the Nazilowrider Car Club of Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California as well as the Vagos Motorcycle Club of Riverside, California
in the year ~2000 - ~2001. We also extended this Web Application Software Project to the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club of Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California in ~2002 - ~2003.

I started writing this web application project in ~2000 when I was ~13.

I did a complete re-write of this Web Application Software Project programming code from 2021 to 2024.
The bare-bone system is now approximately ~250,000 lines of pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code.

What does this web application do now ?

This web application allows the users to communicate with live encrypted voice and video and record encrypted live video to this web application hosted on a private web server
from any mobile device including from any smart glasses that have hardware support for high speed blue-tooth wireless network connection and wireless AP network connection.
Any motorcyclist, driver, traveler can record everything in the area and show their current G.P.S. coordinates location with altitude down to 10 feet in radius. The G.P.S. location of the
recorded media is also saved to the web application directly from the G.P.S. chip of the device itself. This gives a superior advantage over enemy gangs and rivals because
now all enemies can be recorded live to show exactly where they are at, what they look like and what clothes they are wearing with Atomic Time and G.P.S. coordinates.
