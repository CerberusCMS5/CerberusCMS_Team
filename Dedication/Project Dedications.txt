PROJECT DEDICATION FOR MY REAL BIOLOGICAL MOTHER AND MY REAL BIOLOGICAL FATHER

My papa. The King and the drug Baron of East Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California.
Kern County took me from my Nazilowrider biological father when I was 2 years old after Crips gang members shot 2 bullets into the window of his lowrider when I was in the passenger seat in Los Angeles, California. Kern County changed my name after that and gave me to my step-dad.

I started writing the source programming code of this Web Application for him and the Nazilowrider Car Club in the year ~2000 so that we could communicate over the Internet,
so they could sell product and so that he could always prove where he was located at to us by instant message. These were the years of AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger and
Microsoft Windows 1998.

I started writing this Web Application for the Nazilowrider Car Club of Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California as well as the Vagos Motorcycle Club of Riverside, California
in the year ~2000 - ~2001. We also extended this Web Application Software Project to the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club of Bakersfield, California and of Los Angeles, California in ~2002 - ~2003.

I started writing this web application project in ~2000 when I was ~13 after I met my chola. We got the ideas for this web application while she often milked my prostate for several
hours per day while I wrote the programming code for this web application. Many memories of orgies of me with her and her female friends.

I did a complete re-write of this Web Application Software Project programming code from 2021 to 2024.
The bare-bone system is now approximately ~250,000 lines of pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code and should work ultra-fast and flawlessly on the official P.H.P. Versions: 7, 8 and 9 with
support of up to ~500 concurrent and unique network connections to it at any given time.

WHAT DOES THIS WEB APPLICATION DO NOW ?

This web application allows the users to communicate with live encrypted voice and video and record encrypted live video to this web application that is hosted on a private web server
from any mobile electronic device including from any smart glasses that have hardware support for high speed blue-tooth wireless network connection and wireless AP network connection whereas
hand-held radio devices are not encrypted.

Any motorcyclist, driver, traveler can record live video of everything in the area and show their current G.P.S. coordinates location with altitude down to 10 feet in radius every 2
seconds of movement. The G.P.S. location of the recorded media is also saved to this web application directly from the G.P.S. chip of the electronic device itself.

This gives a superior advantage over enemy gangs and rivals because now all enemies can be recorded live to show exactly where they are at, what they look like and what clothes they are wearing with Atomic Precision Time and G.P.S. coordinates where then all allies can see what they look like to send enforcement either then or in the future.

This web application is now written to combat waves of enemy groups where all of the live fire, knife fights and fights can be recorded live from the smart glasses.
The smart glasses also act as an eye protectant from pepper-spray and mace. One can also equip any vehicle with video cameras that have wireless network hardware 
to stream live video to this web application from the dashboard of the vehicle, the rear of the vehicle and the sides of the vehicle.
All license plates, make and model, color and other information of every vehicle in the area can be recorded.

Reverse-Image searches of enemy faces can be made where then their identifying information can be discovered such as name, address and other information.
