Since supposed "allies" have taken so much away from me and given me nothing.. why would I fight for any of you ?
No one in their right mind would ever fight for anyone, be allies with anyone when they take everything away and give them nothing.

I joined an American Indian "gang" where membership is only for those of biological American Indian descent in the U.S.
